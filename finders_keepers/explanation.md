# Finders Keepers

## This challenge is just a way to test .filter()

we are given an array "arr" and a function "func"
We need to build the .filter method with these.

* We are going to create a new array (let it be "newArr") and assign it the value of arr being filtered with func.
* After that we just pick the first element of newArr, and we return it.
